# Turbin3 Solana development (Rust, Anchor and Typescript)

### QUICK NOTE
##### Switch branch to master for each repo module.
This repo contains submodules of tasks and exercises for the WBA builder prog. This is mainly for organization purpose as each submodule already have their own github repo which you can find through my github repositories.
You should pass wallet address as a .json, adjusting the import as your project directory structure requires
